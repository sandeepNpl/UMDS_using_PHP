A donation of medication, when well organized and controlled, can solve the above-mentioned problems and have a very user-friendly website that saves lives and ease suffering. 
        Effective donation practices can provide savings in budgets for development support, so that these services can be used for other purposes.The "Online Unused Medicine Donation System'' serves as a bridge between an immense network of medication donations and Social Organizations (RED CROSS,SCOUT) ,Orphanage,OldAge house.
